We are a dedicated team of developers and designers based in Vienna, Austria.
Our team is experienced in developing stable and secure applications with the
user-friendly interfaces humans deserve in the 21st century. Our vision is to
empower people to take control over their data.

We are building the CloudFleet Blimp, a personal data center for easy-to-use
encrypted email. The idea is that having a private and secure email server
at home should be a plug-and-play experience,
not more complicated than registering a Gmail account.
All of the software running on the CloudFleet Blimp is open
source. We provide a paid CloudFleet services subscription to make the Blimp
usage simple & secure. A subscription to these services supports CloudFleet
development and provides the user:

- custom domain registration and renewal
- software upgrades & security patches
- Pagekite public frontend for global access to your Blimp
- zero-knowledge backups - automatic incremental encrypted backups
of all your data that you can only access using your private encryption key
- public-IP mail relay - for white-listed email transport (mail servers from dynamic IP addresses are often blacklisted as spam by other mail providers)

A more technical description of the CloudFleet Blimp can be found on our
[Technology documentation](http://cloudfleet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/doc/technology/technology.html).

On 29.12.2015 at the Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, we have started
an IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign that lasts for 45 days (until 13.2.2015).
