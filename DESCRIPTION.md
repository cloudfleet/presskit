Data Autonomy
=============

The mission of the company is stated through our
[Data Autonomy manifesto](https://discourse.cloudfleet.io/t/the-data-autonomy-manifesto-first-draft-and-discussion/32?u=kermit)

Embodying the principals of data autonomy, the users of the Blimp are assured
that they are in full control of the data "emissions" of their use of cloud
services.
