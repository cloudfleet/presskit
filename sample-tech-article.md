CloudFleet – Linux-based open source personal data center
=========================================================

The topics of [mass online surveillance][data-surveillance]
and aggressive [user-tracking ads][aggressive-ads] have
been doing rounds in the media for quite some time now.
Traditional cloud services where the data of all users
are stored in a single central data center are beginning to show their negative
side-effects. Enter the [CloudFleet Blimp](https://cloudfleet.io/)
– a personal data center you plug into your
router that gives you your own private cloud services. The team behind
CloudFleet have assembled the best of open source web services, such as Mailpile
for email and Ubuntu One for file sync and did the additional engineering to
make setting your Blimp up a simple account registration and plug-and-play
experience. The CloudFleet Blimp retains the simplicity
of traditional cloud services, while keeping your data encrypted and accessible
only to you.

The CloudFleet Blimp was first previewed at the Chaos Communication Congress in
Hamburg last month. To support development and collect device preorders the team
have started an [IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign][crowdfunding-campaign].
If the idea sounds interesting, take the chance to preorder
your CloudFleet Blimp at an exclusive discount price during the campaign! Since
the software is open source, you can also install it on your own on any Debian
Linux device (even ARM devices like the Raspberry Pi are supported). The more
technical aspects of how the software works and where to get started are
available in the CloudFleet [documentation][documentation].
